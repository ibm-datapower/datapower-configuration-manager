    This ant script template is used to produce a "quickie" ant script that is run from
    within a DCM ant script.  It is expected to inherit all the important properties
    such as dcm.dir and work.dir, and no provision is made for testing for these.
    
    This template requires the ${dcm.jar} ant property.  Also the /generated/antscript
    element must contain the ant scripting to insert into the template.
